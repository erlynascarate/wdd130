    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>Lima, founded in 1535 as the Ciudad de los Reyes,
        (Spanish for "City of Kings"), is the capital and largest city of Peru. It is located in the valleys of the
        Chillón,
        Rímac and Lurín Rivers, in the desert zone of the central coastal part of the country, overlooking the Pacific
        Ocean.
        The city is considered the political, cultural, financial and commercial center of Peru. Due to its geostrategic
        importance, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network has categorized it as a "beta" tier city.
        Jurisdictionally, the metropolis extends mainly within the province of Lima and in a smaller portion, to the
        west,
        within the Constitutional Province of Callao, where the seaport and the Jorge Chávez Airport are located. Both
        provinces
        have regional autonomy since 2002.</p>
